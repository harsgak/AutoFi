	<h1><a id="Hey_0"></a>Hey!</h1>
	<p>You seem to be the curious type, and a savvy one too.<br>
	You know "curiosity killed the cat" right? <br> Dont worry! You're not a cat. And they have nine lives anyway. <br><br> 
	You figured what to do even without instructions. I like that.<br>
	I have something just for you.<br>
	Hereâ€™s a litle <a href="https://harsgak.github.io/AutoFi/">gift</a> for now.</p>
	<p> --Mister.io</p>
	<p>P.S: Come back on Saturday.</p>
	
	<h1><a id="Hey_1"></a>Hey! again</h1>
	<p>Its Saturday. It starts. Did I keep you waiting? 
	<br>"Sabra ka phal meetha hota hai"<br><br>
	
	Did you try that tool I gifted you?	It's getting pro-version soon. More features, more control. <br>
	You want in?<br>
	Alright send a mail to <a href="mailto:iiser.eves@gmail.com?Subject=I%20want%20AutoFi%202" target="_top">iiser.eves@gmail.com</a> 
	with subject "I want AutoFi 2". <br>
	I will make sure the pro-version reaches you.<br>

	<!-- Instructions:
	There is a treasure, You havent seen.
	It is somewhere, you have never been.
	Mine it is not, No I am not that being.
	Ours it could be, if you do this thing.
	If forwards you go,
	Make sure you slow.
	Tip toe you must,
	Or youll be bust.
	From mine hands now, you are off the hook.
	New conversations you begin in her's book.
