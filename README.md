# AutoFi
Auto-login assistant for WiFi captive portal.  
Download: [[apk](https://github.com/harsgak/AutoFi/blob/master/factory/kids/AutoFi.16.apk?raw=true)]

## Why AutoFi?
On IISER Wifi network it is common to get disconnected and reconnected automatically while moving or due to signal fluctuations. When this happens, often a new captive portal requests you for login again.

Sometimes it just fails silently when you are connected to network but login has expired. This can interrupt critical tasks such as WhatsApp, Facebook, IISERMail etc and leave you without updates until you remember to log in again.


## How to use AutoFi?
Just enter your username and password and toggle the Activate AutoLogin switch on, then restart your WiFi.

As long as the switch stays on IISER-AutoFi will automagically login for you every time your phone connects to any IISER Pune WiFi network. You can now blissfully forget about captive portal logins on your android device and go straight to browsing.

When temporarily not needing AutoFi's services or need to change credentials just toggle the Activate AutoLogin switch off. 
_Don't forget to toggle it back on later_


## Compatibility and support. 
This app should work on any Android 4.4+ device with WiFi. Currently supported IISER networks are IISERUG1, IISERUG5, IISERPG and Guest. Note that Faculty, Alpha, IISERCONF are currently **not** supported by default. 

For support, feature request or sending kudos you can send an email by long tapping the developer tags in the app. If you use Github I would prefer you just star this repo and open an [issue](https://github.com/harsgak/AutoFi/issues) for whatever you need.
